# Inbox

The inbox is a capture point for quick thoughts, ideas, and notes that need to be processed later.

## How to Use

1. **Capture quickly** - Don't worry about organization, just get it down
2. **Tag each item** - Use `#idea`, `#note`, `#action`, `#review`, or `#research`
3. **Process regularly** - During daily review, move items to appropriate locations

## Tags

| Tag | Meaning | Goes To |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `#idea` | Concept or possibility | Keep for reference, or create goal |
| `#note` | Observation or reflection | `02_Diary/` with today's date |
| `#action` | Something to do | `02_Diary/` or create as task |
| `#review` | Request for feedback | Creates review report immediately |
| `#research` | Needs investigation | Creates research report immediately |

## Processing

During daily review:
1. Read each item in Inbox
2. Decide where it belongs
3. Move it or link it appropriately
4. Clear processed items from Inbox

**Tip**: Keep your inbox lean. Process it daily so it doesn't become overwhelming.
