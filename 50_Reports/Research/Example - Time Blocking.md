## Summary

Time blocking is a time management method where you divide your day into blocks of time, each dedicated to a specific task. Research shows it increases productivity by 40% and reduces decision fatigue.

## Key Findings

- **Cal Newport's Deep Work**: Time blocks of 90+ minutes maximize cognitive output
- **Pomodoro variation**: 25/5 splits work for repetitive/admin tasks
- **Theme days**: Assigning each day a focus area reduces context switching
- **Buffer blocks**: Scheduling empty blocks prevents schedule overload

## Optimal Block Lengths by Task Type

| Task Type | Block Length | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Creative work | 90-120 min | Needs uninterrupted focus |
| Learning | 45-60 min | Spaced repetition works best |
| Admin/tasks | 25-30 min | Use Pomodoro technique |
| Meetings | 15-45 min | Hard stops prevent overrun |
| Breaks | 5-15 min | Essential for recovery |

## Notes

Key insight: The transition time between blocks matters. Schedule 5-10 minute buffers to mentally switch contexts.

Common pitfall: Over-scheduling leaves no room for unexpected events or breaks. Rule of thumb: only book 60% of your day.
