# Review: Career vs Business Risk

## Feedback

The question of leaving a stable job for entrepreneurship is significant. Here's my analysis based on what you've shared:

**Financial readiness is key** - You mentioned 6 months of savings, which is a solid start but may be tight for a new venture. The standard recommendation is 12-18 months.

**Timing consideration** - You're early in your career, which actually works in your favor. Lower financial obligations and more years to recover from failure make this an ideal window to take calculated risks.

**The idea matters less than execution** - The specific business idea you mentioned has potential competitors, but that's not the deciding factor. Your ability to execute, adapt, and persist matters more.

## Key Points

- You have the right mindset (learning-oriented)
- Financial runway could be longer before going all-in
- Consider testing the business as a side project first
- The "regret minimization" framework: will you regret not trying more than failing?

## Recommendation

Start the business on the side while employed. Set a 6-month timeline to reach $X in monthly revenue. If you hit it, consider going full-time. If not, you've learned valuable skills without major risk.

The best time to start would have been a year ago. The second best time is now.
