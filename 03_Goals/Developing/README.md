# Developing Goals

This folder contains goals that are still being formed or explored.

## When to Use

Put goals here when:
- You're exploring an idea but not ready to commit
- The goal is still vague and needs definition
- You're testing whether it's worth pursuing
- You want to experiment before full commitment

## To Move to Active

When the goal is clear and you're ready to commit:
1. Create proper goal file in `03_Goals/`
2. Create corresponding plan file
3. Delete from Developing folder
