# Remote Work Lifestyle

*Exploring whether to transition to full-time remote work*

## Current Situation

I've been working in an office for 3 years. COVID showed me I can be productive from home. Now I'm considering making remote work permanent.

## Questions to Answer

- Can my current role be done remotely?
- What are the career implications of being fully remote?
- How would this affect my social connections?
- Do I have the discipline to work from home long-term?
- What about the home office setup?

## Exploration Steps

- [ ] Talk to manager about remote options
- [ ] Interview people who made this transition
- [ ] Try a 2-week fully remote trial
- [ ] Research companies that are remote-first
- [ ] Calculate financial impact (commute, meals, etc.)

## Status

*Exploring - not ready to commit yet*

## Notes

This feels like a big life decision. I want to be thoughtful about it rather than impulsive. The exploring period will help me understand if this is right for me.
