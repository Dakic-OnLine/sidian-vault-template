# Monthly Review - 2026-01

## Goals Progress

| Goal | Status | Progress |
|------|--------|----------|
| [[Learn Spanish]] | On Track | 19/30 lessons complete, vocabulary expanding |
| [[Complete writing project]] | On Track | 4/6 chapters drafted |
| [[Exercise regularly]] | Stalled | Only 8 sessions this month |

## What Worked

- Morning study routine for Spanish - consistency is key
- Writing first thing in morning - best creative energy
- Weekly planning keeps me focused on priorities

## What Didn't Work

- Exercise habit fell apart after week 2
- Too many goals at once - spreading myself thin
- Afternoon work sessions consistently unproductive

## Adjustments for February

- Reduce to 2 main goals: Spanish + Writing
- Move exercise to morning (right after meditation)
- Schedule only creative work in mornings
- Reserve afternoons for admin/tasks

## Mood & Energy

Overall mood: Optimistic but occasionally overwhelmed

Energy patterns: High in mornings, low after lunch

## Focus Areas for Next Month

1. Deepen Spanish (aim for 30-day streak)
2. Finish writing draft
3. Rebuild exercise habit (morning only)
