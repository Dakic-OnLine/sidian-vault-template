# 2026-01-15

Started the day with a clear intention to focus on the writing project.

## Morning

Felt energetic after yesterday's exercise. Spent 2 hours on deep work session - made good progress on chapter 3.

## Afternoon

Got distracted by email. Need to set better boundaries around checking messages.

## Evening

Reflection: today was productive overall, but the afternoon slump is becoming a pattern. Should consider scheduling creative work for morning only.

## Mood

Content but aware of room for improvement.
